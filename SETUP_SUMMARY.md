  - `pt_style.py` - Prompt Toolkit styling
  - `utils.py` - Utility functions
  - `settings.py` - Settings management
  - `main.py` - Original main entry point
  - `entry.py` - Entry point utilities

### 3. Project Configuration

## 🔧 Package Management

The project uses UV for fast, modern Python package management with Poetry compatibility.

## 📦 Dependencies

### Main Dependencies
- `prompt-toolkit>=3.0.0` - Terminal UI framework
- `openhands` - Agent SDK from specified commit

### Development Dependencies
- `pytest>=7.0.0` - Testing framework
- `black>=23.0.0` - Code formatter
- `isort>=5.0.0` - Import sorter
- `flake8>=6.0.0` - Linter
- `mypy>=1.0.0` - Type checker


## 🎯 Current Status

The CLI is successfully set up with:
- ✅ Working package structure
- ✅ UV package management
- ✅ Poetry compatibility
- ✅ Build automation with Make
- ✅ Development tools configured

The CLI currently runs a simplified version that demonstrates the setup. To enable full TUI functionality, additional dependencies and configuration may be needed based on the specific OpenHands agent requirements.

## 🔄 Next Steps

To extend functionality:
1. Add missing dependencies (e.g., pydantic) as needed
2. Configure agent SDK integration
3. Set up environment variables and authentication
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Enhance the TUI with full OpenHands integration
